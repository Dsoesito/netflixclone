# Netflix Clone 

Hello! This is a clone of the Netflix website that I built while following a tutorial by Sonny Sangha üòÅ

* Credit card info can be input and actual payments go through stripe
* When loged in, users can view home page and selection of movies
* All movvie posters taken from TMDB (The Movie Data Base) API

## Architecture
This app was built with React.JS, HTML, CSS, Firebase v9, Next Auth, Redux, TMDB API, and hosted/deployed with Firebase deploy. This app is a fully funtional React app built on the concept of "components". All part of the app are broken up in to components (Banner, Navigation, Home Screen, Login Screen, Plan Screen, Profile Screen, Sign Up Screen) and thus can be reused as necessary. 

Redux is also used to track the "state" of the user's login status and thus allow certain permissions only allowed to users with accounts. 

Lastly, the payments and back end are all handled by Firebase Extentions that connect to stripe payment. Thus all data is stored on Firebase v9, from user information, user subscriptions status, and "plan" selection.
